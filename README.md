## Overview
Trading decisions have always been subjective i.e., there is `no definitive answer` for a decision when a `trader buys/sells/holds` a stock. This means that the subject-matter experts are in high demand, and we need to `invest in automation` to minimize human intervention. So let us explore the feasibility of building a new system that can `replicate the way humans trade`.

## Introduction
We will be analyzing the daily data of S&P 500 Global index from `03-Jan-1983` till `18-Jun-2021`.We will use this data and `generate images and labels (buy/sell/hold)` using some popular trading strategies. Then we use these `images and train the model` to classify the images and `compare that with the labels` that we have generated for performance evaluation.

## Trading Strategies
### a. Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands are widely used among traders. The indicator comprises an `upper band`, `lower band` and `moving average line`. The two trading bands are placed `two standard deviations` above and below the moving average (usually 20 periods) line. We use two standard deviations to capture a confidence interval of 95%. In the below image, we will make a `sell` decision when the `actual closing index crosses` the `upper band` and a `buy` decision when `actual closing index falls below` the `lower band`.

### b. Relative strength index
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate `overbought` or `oversold` conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is calculated using the formula `[100 - 100/(1+RS)]` where `RS` is the ratio of the Exponential Moving Average (window = 14) of all positive changes to the negative ones. An asset/stock is usually considered `overbought` => `ready to sell` when the RSI is `above 70%`and `oversold` => `ready to buy` when it is `below 30%`. In the below image, we `sell` at `red` arrows and `buy` at the `blue` ones.

## Methodology
Now that we have understood about the trading strategies, let us apply these to the `S&P 500 Global index data`. Below are the steps I have preformed to achieve this.

### 1.Image Generation
We have pulled the required data from `yahoo finance`. This provides information about the daily `open`,`close`,`high` and `low` values for the S&P 500 index. But, our `goal` is to `mimic the human decision`; and traders look at the trend graph and make a decision by using their quantitative finance knowledge. So we now generate images using the tabular data.

#### Data Collection
I have used `yahoo finance` API to get the data. Below is the code I have used to pull the data. You can change the `ticker`, `start` and `end` dates to get data for different stocks.
```python
import fix_yahoo_finance as yf
 
# Pull data from yahoo
ticker = '^GSPC'
df = yf.download(ticker, start='1983-01-01', end='2021-06-20')
```
#### Data Preparation
Below is the data structure of our tabular data. We use the `Close` value of each day for our whole analysis. Now we apply the `Bollinger Bands & RSI` strategies to the Close value and calculate the `Moving Average (SMA)`, `Bands (UB & LB)` and `RSI (RSI) index` for each day.

| Date     | Open    | High    | Low     | Close   | Adj Close | Volume     |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 14-06-21 | 4248.31 | 4255.59 | 4234.07 | 4255.15 | 4255.15   | 3612050000 |
| 15-06-21 | 4255.28 | 4257.16 | 4238.35 | 4246.59 | 4246.59   | 3578450000 |
| 16-06-21 | 4248.87 | 4251.89 | 4202.45 | 4223.7  | 4223.7    | 3722050000 |
| 17-06-21 | 4220.37 | 4232.29 | 4196.05 | 4221.86 | 4221.86   | 3952110000 |

#### Signal Generation
Based on the values of the above table, we generate signal indicators for each day. Below is the data after the signal generation. `1 --> Buy`, `-1 --> Sell` and `0 --> Hold`

|   Date   |  Close  |   SMA   |    UB   |    LB   |  RSI  | BB Signal | RSI Signal |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---------:|:----------:|
| 06-05-21 | 4201.62 | 4167.12 | 4219.78 | 4114.46 | 61.75 |     0     |      0     |
| 07-05-21 | 4232.60 | 4172.31 | 4229.34 | 4115.28 | 68.70 |     -1    |      0     |
| 10-05-21 | 4188.43 | 4175.33 | 4228.77 | 4121.89 | 52.89 |     0     |      0     |
| 11-05-21 | 4152.10 | 4175.86 | 4228.09 | 4123.62 | 43.41 |     0     |      0     |
| 12-05-21 | 4063.04 | 4172.78 | 4242.17 | 4103.38 | 28.81 |     1     |      1     |

#### Image Labeling
As we created signals for three outcomes, `buy/sell/hold` let us limit our decisions to either buying or selling as a first strategy. So we are going to `create images and label them either buy/sell` based on the `BB Signal/ RSI Signal`. I have created images of size `125 x 125` and labeled them as `buy if the trading strategy suggests a buy` or sell otherwise. The distribution of images is below for each strategy.

|      Strategy      |  Buy  |   Sell   |
|:------------------:|:-----:|:--------:|
| Bollinger Bands    |  433  |   461    |
| Rel Strength Index |  651  |   1721   |

### 2.Feature Engineering
We now have the images, but we need to capture the spatial information and reduce the dimensions of the neural network that we are planning to train. I have performed the below steps to achieve these goals.

#### Rescaling
The image is now in the RGB format, we will rescale the image into size of `64 x 64 x 3` using the below code.
```python
# Import the Libraries
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
# Preprocessing the Training set
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255,
                                   shear_range = 0.2,
                                   zoom_range = 0.2,
                                   horizontal_flip = True)

training_set = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('train_data_dir',
                                                 target_size = (64, 64),
                                                 batch_size = 32,
                                                 class_mode = 'binary')
```
#### Model Architecture
This rescaled image of size `64 x 64 x 3` is passed as the input to the below network.
![model](stockpred/images/model.png)

- The convolution layers have `32 filters` of kernel size `3 x 3` and the max pooling layers have `32 filters` of kernel size `2 x 2`. 
- The output after the first convolution layer has the size `62 x 62` because `Output Size = Input Size - Kernel Size + 1`.
- The size of the output from the first max pooling layer is `31 x 31` because `Output Size = InputSize / Kernel Size`.
- We need to flatten the `32 filters` of the images of size `14 x 14`, so we add a dense layer with `6272 (14 x 14 x 32)` neurons, followed by a fully connected layer with size of 128.
- The activation function used here is `sigmoid` for the buy or sell binary decision.

### 3.Modeling
Now we have the images and model architecture ready, so let us proceed with the modeling part. The important things to keep in mind here is to not `overfit` the data and select a `robust performance metric` for a classification problem like this.
#### Train & Validation Split
I have used stratified selection approach to split the data into training & validation. You can see the split details in the below table for a `validation size of 20%` of the whole data. The training data is passed into the above model architecture. We are going to validate the model on the validation data on some performance metrics. 
![split](stockpred/images/Train_Val.png)
#### Performance Metrics 
I have selected `Accuracy, Area Under the Curve and F1-Score` as my model's performance metrics. After a lot of due diligence, I have achieved a validation `AUC of 0.99` for the `Buy/Sell` classification using both `BB & RSI strategies`. The other model's results are below.

## Conclusion
- Based on the results of the study, we can conclude that we can build a system that identifies and replicates the way humans trade.
- Since 2010, the RSI has performed incredibly well with a median of close to 4% monthly returns for buys - [Source](https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/tebiwkly08-52167/)
- This model can be improved over time to tell the trader how much to buy/sell, rather than a yes/no for an investment, to maximize the returns.
- This model can be developed into a product to assist investment companies on a large scale with high computing capabilities.
- If you like the approach and want to `replicate`, start with the `requirements.txt` file to install all the required packages and run the codes after this.
